# tRPC API Boilerplate

[![CI][ci-badge]][ci-url]

Minimal tRPC API boilerplate. Easily build &amp; publish fully typesafe APIs that any frontend can consume.

Monorepos are great, but sometimes we are targeting backend and frontend as separate (mono)repositories:

- separation/encapsulation of backend and frontend domain (except what must be exposed to both through API).
- separation of backend and frontend developers (larger teams/companies).
- separation of backend and frontend CI/CD pipelines.

... in that case checkout this boilerplate.

## Running

_Easily set up a local development environment_

- fork & clone repo
- `npm install`
- make changes to tRPC API & `npm run trpc-api-export`
- push changes and consume tRPC API with any frontend app ðŸš€
