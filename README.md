# tRPC API Boilerplate

Minimal tRPC API boilerplate. Easily build &amp; publish fully typesafe APIs that any frontend can consume.

Monorepos are great, but if frontend and backend are in separate repositories, checkout this boilerplate.  
It's useful when strict separation of backend and frontend domain & developers (especially in larger teams/companies) is targeted.

## Running

_Easily set up a local development environment_

- fork & clone repo
- `npm install`
- make changes to tRPC API & `npm run export-trpc-api`
- push changes and and consume tRPC API with any frontend app ðŸš€

## Example Repo
